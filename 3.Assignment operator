// Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator //
var a;
var b = 2;
a =7;
b = a;



//It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;
